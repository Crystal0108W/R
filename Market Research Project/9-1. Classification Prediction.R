# Prediction: Classification 
# Problem 1: predicting segment membership
# Problem 2: predicting who is likely to subscribe to a service

# Steps: 
# 1, A data set is collected in which group membership for each observation is known or assigned
# (e.g., assigned by behavioral observation, expert rating, or clustering procedures).
# 2. The data set is split into a training set and a test set. A common pattern is to select 50â€“80 % of the observations for the training set (67 % seems to be particularly common), and to assign the remaining observations to the test set. 
# 3. A prediction model is built, with a goal to predict membership in the training data as well as possible.
# 4. The resulting model is then assessed for performance using the test data. Per- formance is assessed to see that it exceeds chance (base rate). Additionally one might assess whether the method performs better than a reasonable alternative (and simpler or better-known) model.
